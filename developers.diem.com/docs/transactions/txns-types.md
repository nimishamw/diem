In this section, we will be covering three types of transactions that can be sent by different types of accounts:

* [Transactions that send payments to other accounts.](/docs/transactions/txns-types/txns-send-payment.md)
* [Transactions that are sent to create accounts, and for minting and burning Diem Coins](txns-create-accounts-mint.md).
* [Transactions to help with account recovery, key rotation, adding currencies and other account administration tasks](txns-manage-accounts.md)).
